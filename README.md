Middleware that talks to the control software of the PADE boards and receives data from the PADE boards

As of 6-29-2014 all the code's very rough and not particularly easy to follow. It should compile 
*fingers-crossed*, assuming you have the following libraries: libevent, ROOT, C++, C++ socket stuff, and google's profiling tools. 
You can find the profiling tools at: http://code.google.com/p/gperftools/
   
Expect massive changes in the next few weeks, along with some sample PADE packet generation tools.
